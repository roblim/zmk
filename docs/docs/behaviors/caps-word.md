## Summary

The caps word behavior behaves similar to a caps lock, but it will automatically deactivate at the end of a word. This is useful for typing single words in all capitals, such as abbreviations or identifiers in code. This is especially useful for smaller keyboards using [mod-taps](/docs/behaviors/mod-tap), where it can help avoid repeated alternating holds when typing words in all caps.

When caps word is active, Shift is added to capitalize letters and change `-` to `_`. Caps word deactivates at the end of a word, that is when any key is pressed other than alphanumeric characters, `MINUS`, `UNDERSCORE`, `BACKSPACE`, or `DELETE`. It also deactivates if the caps word key is pressed again, or when the keyboard is idle for 5 seconds.

### Behavior Binding

- Reference: `&caps_word`

Example:

```
&caps_word
```

### Configuration

#### Shift List

By default, caps word will apply the Shift modifier to alpha keys and `MINUS`. If you would like to override this, you can set a new array of keys in the `shift-list` property in your keymap. Any keys added to this list will both continue the word and be shifted.

For example, to remove `MINUS` from the list so it isn't changed to `UNDERSCORE`, add:

```
&caps_word {
    shift-list = <>;
};

/ {
    keymap {
        ...
    };
};
```

Alpha keys are automatically included in the list. This can be disabled by adding a [`no-default-keys`](#non-us-layouts) property.

#### Continue List

By default, caps word will remain active when any alphanumeric key, modifier key, key listed in `shift-list`, or `UNDERSCORE`, `BACKSPACE`, or `DELETE` is pressed. Any other key will turn off caps word. If you would like to override this, you can set a new array of keys in the `continue-list` property in your keymap. Any keys added to this list will continue a word but not be shifted.

For example, to add left/right arrow keys to the default list, add:

```
&caps_word {
    continue-list = <UNDERSCORE BACKSPACE DELETE LEFT RIGHT>;
};

/ {
    keymap {
        ...
    };
};
```

Alphanumeric keys are automatically included in the list. This can be disabled by adding a [`no-default-keys`](#non-us-layouts) property.

#### Applied Modifier(s)

In addition, if you would like caps word to apply different or _multiple_ modifiers instead of just `MOD_LSFT`, you can override the `mods` property:

```
&caps_word {
    mods = <(MOD_LSFT | MOD_LALT)>;
};

/ {
    keymap {
        ...
    };
};
```

#### Idle Timeout

By default, caps word turns off automatically if no keys are pressed for 5 seconds. This can be changed by setting the `idle-timeout-ms` property in your keymap. This value is in milliseconds.

For example, this would change the timeout to 10 seconds:

```
&caps_word {
    idle-timeout-ms = <10000>;
};
```

Setting the timeout to 0 configures caps word to never time out. It will remain active until you press a key that turns off caps word.

### Non-US Layouts

Alphanumeric keys (A-Z, 0-9) are automatically included in `continue-list`, and alpha keys (A-Z) are automatically included in `shift-list`. This may result in unexpected behaviors for some OS keyboard layouts, for example in Dvorak where the quote key sends the Q keycode, and therefore is treated as continuing a word. You can disable this and manually specify the full lists by adding a `no-default-keys` property:

```
// Keycodes for Dvorak layout
#define DV_A A
#define DV_B N
...

&caps_word {
    no-default-keys;
    continue-list = <N0 N1 N2 N3 N4 N5 N6 N7 N8 N9 DV_UNDER BACKSPACE DELETE>;
    shift-list = <DV_A DV_B DV_C ... DV_Z DV_MINUS>;
};
```

### Multiple Caps Breaks

If you want to use multiple caps breaks with different codes to break the caps, you can add additional caps words instances to use in your keymap:

```
/ {
    prog_caps: behavior_prog_caps_word {
        compatible = "zmk,behavior-caps-word";
        label = "PROG_CAPS";
        #binding-cells = <0>;
        continue-list = <UNDERSCORE>;
    };

    keymap {
        ...
    };
};
```
